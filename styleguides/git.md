# Git

Following are our Git conventions that should be followed. We like clean, cohesive,
and consistent history.

## Commits

### Commit Messaging

Here's a good sample commit message:

    Component: Add new ability to find users [Closes #29]

    Some more information on this edit. Why it was needed. Any refs to
    Github issues or sources go here.

### Squash Commits

Before pushing your changes it's good practice to squash extra commits into as
small pieces as possible.
